# Two-Phase Mode Skill

## Overview

Two-Phase Mode separates orchestration into two distinct phases:

## Prerequisites

- AI Maestro messaging system running
- GitHub CLI (gh) authenticated
- Remote agents registered by user
- Understanding of YAML frontmatter state files

## Output

| Output Type | Location | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Plan Phase State | `.claude/orchestrator-plan-phase.local.md` | YAML frontmatter with requirements, modules, criteria |
| Orchestration State | `.claude/orchestrator-orchestration-phase.local.md` | YAML frontmatter with agent assignments, module status |
| Design Documents | `design/<platform>/` | Templates, handoffs, RDD files, specs |
| GitHub Issues | GitHub repository | Module issues created from approved plan |
| Claude Tasks | Claude Code session | Persistent task tracking across compacting |

## Instructions

1. **Understand the two phases**: Plan Phase (requirements) and Orchestration Phase (implementation).

   | Phase | Purpose | Activities | Exit Condition |
   |-------|---------|------------|----------------|
   | **Plan Phase** | Write requirements | Design specs, architecture, task breakdown | All requirements documented + user approval |
   | **Orchestration Phase** | Direct implementation | Coordinate remote agents module by module | All modules implemented + 4 verification loops |

2. **Start Plan Phase**: Use `/start-planning` command to create state file and begin requirements documentation.

3. **Document requirements**: Write USER_REQUIREMENTS.md, define architecture, break down modules, set acceptance criteria.

4. **Approve plan**: Use `/approve-plan` to transition to Orchestration Phase and create GitHub issues.

5. **Start Orchestration Phase**: Use `/start-orchestration` to initialize orchestration state file.

6. **Register agents**: Use `/register-agent` to register remote AI agents or human developers.

7. **Assign modules**: Use `/assign-module` to assign modules to registered agents.

8. **Verify instructions**: Execute Instruction Verification Protocol before authorizing implementation.

9. **Poll progress**: Use `/check-agents` every 10-15 minutes to actively poll implementers.

10. **Handle updates**: If requirements change, use Instruction Update Verification Protocol.

11. **Complete verification loops**: Each module requires 4 verification loops before completion.

12. **Exit when complete**: Stop hook ensures all modules are complete before allowing exit.

## Core Principle: Dynamic Flexibility with Completion Enforcement

The orchestrator enforces completion of CURRENT tasks while allowing dynamic modifications.

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **User can always** | Add features, change requirements, remove pending items |
| **System enforces** | All CURRENT tasks must complete before stopping |
| **Dynamic tracking** | Stop hook checks CURRENT state, not original state |

**How it works:** If user adds OAuth2 module, stop hook blocks until OAuth2 is ALSO complete. If user removes OAuth2 (before started), it's no longer tracked.

---

## Core Principle: Claude Tasks Scheduling (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY**: All instructions must be immediately scheduled as Claude Tasks. This is non-negotiable.

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Immediate scheduling** | When receiving any instruction, create Claude Tasks FIRST before acting |
| **Persistence across compacting** | Claude Tasks persist via TaskList API, surviving context compacting |
| **Series closure** | Every task series ends with: verification checklist, archive record, commit |
| **Recovery capability** | Agents can recover state after compacting by reading Claude Tasks |

**Why this matters:** Claude Code context windows compact during long sessions. Without Claude Tasks, agents forget instructions and progress. Claude Code native Tasks provide persistent memory.

See [references/native-task-persistence.md](references/native-task-persistence.md) for complete documentation.

Solutions for common issues in Two-Phase Mode.

| 2. Orchestration Phase Issues | Stop hook blocks, module stuck, verification loops |
| 3. State File Issues | Corruption, YAML parse error, sync issues |
| 4. Communication Issues | Agent not responding, messages not delivered, notifications |
| 5. Stop Hook Issues | Not firing, allows exit incorrectly, blocks incorrectly |

**When to use:** When encountering errors, debugging issues, resolving problems.

---

## Agent Types

| Agent Type | Location | Assignment Method | Communication |
|------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Local Subagents** | Same Claude Code | Spawned by orchestrator | Direct (Task tool) |
| **Remote AI Agents** | Independent sessions | User-provided agent IDs | AI Maestro messages |
| **Human Developers** | GitHub | GitHub Project Kanban | GitHub notifications |

**Important:** Only user-provided agent IDs should be involved, NOT all agents on AI Maestro network.

---

## Stop Hook Enforcement

The stop hook (`eoa_orchestrator_stop_check.py`) is **phase-aware** and enforces:

| Phase | Blocks Exit If |
|-------|---------------|
| Plan Phase | `plan_phase_complete: false` |
| Orchestration Phase | Any module not complete |
| Orchestration Phase | Verification loops remaining > 0 |

**Dynamic enforcement:** Stop hook always checks CURRENT state. If user adds/removes modules, the new state is what gets enforced.

```bash
# PLAN PHASE
/start-planning
# Document requirements in USER_REQUIREMENTS.md
# Define architecture and modules
/approve-plan

# ORCHESTRATION PHASE
/start-orchestration --project-id PVT_kwDOB1234567
