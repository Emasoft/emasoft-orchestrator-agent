# Two-Phase Mode Skill

## Overview

Two-Phase Mode separates orchestration into two distinct phases:

| Phase | Purpose | Activities | Exit Condition |
|-------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Plan Phase** | Write requirements | Design specs, architecture, task breakdown | All requirements documented + user approval |
| **Orchestration Phase** | Direct implementation | Coordinate remote agents module by module | All modules implemented + 4 verification loops |

## Core Principle: Dynamic Flexibility with Completion Enforcement

The orchestrator enforces completion of CURRENT tasks while allowing dynamic modifications.

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **User can always** | Add features, change requirements, remove pending items |
| **System enforces** | All CURRENT tasks must complete before stopping |
| **Dynamic tracking** | Stop hook checks CURRENT state, not original state |

**How it works:** If user adds OAuth2 module, stop hook blocks until OAuth2 is ALSO complete. If user removes OAuth2 (before started), it's no longer tracked.

---

## Core Principle: Claude Tasks Scheduling (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY**: All instructions must be immediately scheduled as Claude Tasks. This is non-negotiable.

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Immediate scheduling** | When receiving any instruction, create Claude Tasks FIRST before acting |
| **Persistence across compacting** | Claude Tasks persist via TaskList API, surviving context compacting |
| **Series closure** | Every task series ends with: verification checklist, archive record, commit |
| **Recovery capability** | Agents can recover state after compacting by reading Claude Tasks |

**Why this matters:** Claude Code context windows compact during long sessions. Without Claude Tasks, agents forget instructions and progress. Claude Code native Tasks provide persistent memory.

See [references/native-task-persistence.md](references/native-task-persistence.md) for complete documentation.

---

## Agent Types

| Agent Type | Location | Assignment Method | Communication |
|------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Local Subagents** | Same Claude Code | Spawned by orchestrator | Direct (Task tool) |
| **Remote AI Agents** | Independent sessions | User-provided agent IDs | AI Maestro messages |
| **Human Developers** | GitHub | GitHub Project Kanban | GitHub notifications |

**Important:** Only user-provided agent IDs should be involved, NOT all agents on AI Maestro network.

---

## Stop Hook Enforcement

The stop hook (`atlas_orchestrator_stop_check.py`) is **phase-aware** and enforces:

| Phase | Blocks Exit If |
|-------|---------------|
| Plan Phase | `plan_phase_complete: false` |
| Orchestration Phase | Any module not complete |
| Orchestration Phase | Verification loops remaining > 0 |

**Dynamic enforcement:** Stop hook always checks CURRENT state. If user adds/removes modules, the new state is what gets enforced.
