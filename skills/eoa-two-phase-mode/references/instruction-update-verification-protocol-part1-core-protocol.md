# Instruction Update Verification Protocol - Part 1: Core Protocol

**Parent document:** [instruction-update-verification-protocol.md](instruction-update-verification-protocol.md)

This part covers:
- When this protocol applies
- The 5-step update verification flow
- Message templates
- Tracking update verification

## 1. When This Protocol Applies

### 1.1 Triggers for this protocol

This protocol is triggered when the orchestrator sends **ANY** of the following to an implementer who is already working:

| Trigger | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Requirement change** | Modification to acceptance criteria | "Add 2FA support to login" |
| **Design update** | Changed technical approach | "Use Redis instead of in-memory cache" |
| **Spec clarification** | Detailed expansion of ambiguous specs | "Token expiry means access token only" |
| **Scope adjustment** | Added or removed features | "Remove social login, add LDAP" |
| **Priority change** | Reordering of implementation priority | "Do auth before API, not after" |
| **Toolchain update** | Changed dependencies or tools | "Upgrade to library v3" |
| **Integration change** | Modified external interfaces | "New endpoint format from partner API" |

**Key distinction:** This is for MID-IMPLEMENTATION changes, not initial assignments.

### 1.2 Distinction from Initial Verification

| Protocol | When Used | Focus |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Instruction Verification Protocol** | Before work starts | Full understanding of original requirements |
| **Instruction UPDATE Verification Protocol** | During work | Understanding of CHANGES and their impact |

The initial verification establishes baseline understanding. This protocol ensures CHANGES are understood in context of ongoing work.

### 1.3 Distinction from Regular Polling

| Protocol | When Used | Focus |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Proactive Progress Polling** | Every 10-15 minutes | Status check, issue detection |
| **Instruction UPDATE Verification Protocol** | After sending updates | Verification of specific changes |

Regular polling is scheduled. This protocol is triggered by specific update events.

## 2. The 5-Step Update Verification Flow

```
ORCHESTRATOR                              IMPLEMENTER
     |                                         |
     |  1. Send Update Notification            |
     |  (What changed, why, impact)            |
     |---------------------------------------->|
     |                                         |
     |  2. Request Confirmation of Receipt     |
     |  "Please confirm you received this      |
     |   update and PAUSE current work"        |
     |---------------------------------------->|
     |                                         |
     |  3. Request Feasibility Assessment      |
     |  "Is this change clear and feasible?    |
     |   Do you need more info? Any concerns?" |
     |---------------------------------------->|
     |                                         |
     |  4. Implementer Responds                |
     |  (Clear/unclear, feasible/concerns)     |
     |<----------------------------------------|
     |                                         |
     |  If concerns: Address them (loop)       |
     |  If clear: Proceed to step 5            |
     |---------------------------------------->|
     |                                         |
     |  5. Authorize Resume                    |
     |  "You may resume with these changes"    |
     |---------------------------------------->|
     |                                         |
     |  Implementer Resumes Work               |
     |                                         |
```

### 2.1 Step 1: Send Update Notification

Send AI Maestro message with:
- **WHAT changed** - Specific requirements/design elements modified
- **WHY it changed** - Rationale for the change
- **IMPACT assessment** - What parts of current work are affected
- **INVALIDATION notice** - What previous instructions are superseded

**CRITICAL:** Include explicit statement that previous related instructions are INVALIDATED.

### 2.2 Step 2: Request Confirmation of Receipt

Require implementer to:
1. Acknowledge receipt of the update
2. PAUSE current work immediately
3. Review the changes before continuing

**DO NOT** let implementer continue with old instructions while processing update.

### 2.3 Step 3: Request Feasibility Assessment

Ask the implementer explicitly:
1. **Is this change clear?** (Do you understand what's being asked?)
2. **Is this feasible?** (Can you implement this with current resources/time?)
3. **Do you need more information?** (What's missing or unclear?)
4. **Any concerns?** (Technical issues, conflicts with other work, etc.)
5. **Any configuration needs?** (Do you need config changes from orchestrator?)

### 2.4 Step 4: Address Concerns

If implementer raises concerns:
1. **Technical concerns:** Provide solutions or adjust requirements
2. **Clarity concerns:** Explain in more detail with examples
3. **Feasibility concerns:** Negotiate scope or provide alternatives
4. **Configuration needs:** Integrate their requirements (see Part 2, Section 6)

**Loop until all concerns addressed.** Do not authorize resume with unresolved concerns.

### 2.5 Step 5: Authorize Resume

Send explicit authorization:
```
UPDATE VERIFICATION COMPLETE.
You may resume work with the following changes incorporated:
- [List specific changes]

Previous instruction for [X] is INVALIDATED.
New instruction is [Y].

Resume work.
```
