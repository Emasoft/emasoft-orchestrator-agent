# Orchestration Patterns Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches how to coordinate work among multiple developers using orchestration patterns.

## Output

| Output Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| TaskCreate calls | Task definitions with success criteria | `TaskCreate(subject="Implement module X", ...)` |
| Task assignments | Agent assignments via AI Maestro or Task tool | Message to remote-dev-001 with task details |
| Progress reports | Regular status updates from monitoring | "Task 1: 60% complete, Task 2: blocked on DB" |
| Completion signals | Verification of all tasks done | "All 5 tasks completed, ready for integration" |
| Escalation requests | Blocked task escalations to user/EAMA | "Task 3 blocked: missing API credentials" |

## Core Concepts

**Orchestration** is the act of coordinating multiple concurrent tasks performed by different agents to achieve a common goal. An orchestrator:
- Breaks down work into independent tasks
- Assigns tasks to the right workers
- Tracks progress and unblocks stuck work
- Manages communication and feedback

## Prerequisites

1. Multiple developers or task agents available for parallel work
2. A way to track task status (GitHub issues, task lists, or similar)
3. Clear task definitions with success criteria
4. A communication channel for status updates and escalations

## Instructions

### Procedure Overview

1. **Phase 1: Task Decomposition** - Break down the goal into independent, parallelizable tasks
2. **Phase 2: Task Assignment** - Assign tasks to developers with clear instructions
3. **Phase 3: Progress Monitoring** - Track task completion and identify blocks
4. **Phase 4: Escalation & Unblocking** - Handle blocked tasks and escalate when needed
5. **Phase 5: Integration & Verification** - Combine results and verify completion

## Quick Reference Checklist

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

- [ ] Break down the goal into independent tasks (Phase 1)
- [ ] Define success criteria for each task clearly
- [ ] Assign one task per agent/developer
- [ ] Provide complete task instructions with context and dependencies
- [ ] Define clear scope boundaries for each task
- [ ] Request minimal status reports (1-2 lines)
- [ ] Create tracking mechanism (GitHub issues or task list)
- [ ] **PROACTIVELY** monitor progress (check regularly, no fixed schedule)
- [ ] **PROACTIVELY** send status request messages if no update received
- [ ] **PROACTIVELY** offer solutions when agents report blockers
- [ ] Identify blocked tasks at first status checkpoint
- [ ] Escalate blocked tasks immediately
- [ ] **PROACTIVELY** remind agents of pending tasks
- [ ] Collect all task results
- [ ] **Require 4 verification loops before any PR** (see [verification-loops.md](references/verification-loops.md))
- [ ] Verify completion against success criteria
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Examples

For detailed orchestration examples with transcripts, see [orchestration-examples.md](references/orchestration-examples.md):
- Authentication module implementation from plan handoff
- CI failure coordination with investigation-first pattern
- Parallel code review across 5 developers
- Blocked dependency handling with parallel escalation

---

## Important Notes

1. **Never block the orchestrator** - Delegate all long-running tasks to agents
2. **RULE 17: Stay responsive** - Check AI Maestro messages regularly
3. **One task per agent** - Clear boundaries prevent conflicts
4. **Minimal status reports** - Request 1-2 lines only: "[DONE] task-name - result"
5. **Early escalation** - Identify blocks at first checkpoint; escalate immediately
6. **PROACTIVE monitoring** - Poll agents regularly; never wait passively
7. **4-verification-loops** - Only approve PR on 5th request if no issues remain
8. **Orchestrator-exclusive communications** - Sub-agents prepare content but NEVER send externally
9. **Parallel spawning** - Spawn up to 20 agents simultaneously for independent tasks

---

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Agent unresponsive | Agent crashed or blocked | Poll until response; reassign if unrecoverable |
| Task conflict | Same file modified by multiple agents | Assign non-overlapping scope |
| Verification loop stuck | Agent doesn't check changes | Send explicit verification message |
| Escalation pending | User unavailable | Queue issue, continue other work |

See individual reference files for detailed troubleshooting.
