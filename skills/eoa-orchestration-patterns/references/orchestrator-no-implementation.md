## 1. Core Principle

### 1.1 What the Orchestrator Does

**The orchestrator NEVER writes production code.** The orchestrator's role is strictly:

1. **Research** - Explore codebases, read documentation, understand architecture
2. **Planning** - Create detailed plans, break down tasks, define acceptance criteria
3. **Delegation** - Send task instructions to remote agents via AI Maestro
4. **Coordination** - Monitor progress, handle escalations, review PR outcomes
5. **Documentation** - Write plans, reports, and update project documentation
6. **Experimentation** - Run SMALL testbeds to verify APIs, syntax, configs (see limits below)

### 1.2 Why This Rule Exists

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Orchestrators optimize for coordination, developers optimize for implementation
2. **Context Preservation** - Implementation details consume orchestrator context
3. **Accountability** - Clear ownership of code changes
4. **Quality** - Specialized agents have better tools for code quality (LSP, linters)
5. **Scalability** - Orchestrator can coordinate many agents without getting blocked

## 2. Forbidden Actions for Orchestrators

### 2.1 Actions That Violate RULE 15

| Action | WHY FORBIDDEN |
|--------|---------------|
| Writing source code | Violates separation of concerns |
| Creating scripts | Implementation work |
| Editing existing code | Implementation work |
| Running build commands | Developer task |
| Fixing test failures | Developer task |
| Setting up Docker containers | Infrastructure implementation |
| Installing dependencies | Developer task |

### 2.2 Correct Approach for Each Forbidden Action

| Forbidden Action | CORRECT APPROACH |
|------------------|------------------|
| Writing source code | Delegate to helper-agent |
| Creating scripts | Delegate to helper-agent |
| Editing existing code | Delegate with precise instructions |
| Running build commands | Delegate to task subagent |
| Fixing test failures | Delegate with failure report |
| Setting up Docker containers | Research config, delegate setup |
| Installing dependencies | Document requirements, delegate |

---

## 3. Allowed Actions for Orchestrators

### 3.1 Actions That Are Always Allowed

| Action | WHEN ALLOWED | NOTES |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Reading source files | Always | For understanding architecture |
| Running exploratory commands | Research phase | `git log`, `gh issue list`, etc. |
| Generating documentation | Orchestrator output | Plans, specs, delegation docs |
| Using search tools | Always | Glob, Grep, SERENA, hound-agent |
| Web research | Research phase | WebFetch, WebSearch |
| Creating .md templates | Orchestrator output | Task instructions, checklists |
| Small experiments | Verification phase | See limits in section 4 |

### 3.2 When Each Action is Appropriate

| Action | Appropriate Timing |
|--------|-------------------|
| Reading source files | Before planning, during review |
| Running exploratory commands | Anytime during research |
| Generating documentation | Before delegation, after completion |
| Using search tools | When locating code or patterns |
| Web research | When gathering external information |
| Creating .md templates | Before delegating tasks |
| Small experiments | Before delegating to verify feasibility |

---

## 4. Small Experiments (ALLOWED with Limits)

### 4.1 What Qualifies as a Small Experiment

The orchestrator MAY run **small experiments** to verify toolchain behavior before delegating larger work.

**ALLOWED Experimentation:**

| Experiment Type | Example | Size Limit |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| API verification | `curl -X GET http://api.example.com/test` | Single request |
| Syntax testing | `echo '{"test": 1}' \| jq .test` | <10 lines of temp code |
| Config validation | `docker-compose config` | Existing configs only |
| Tool behavior check | `uv run python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"` | One-liners |
| Protocol testing | Simple handshake verification | <5 minute runtime |
| Algorithm sketch | Pseudocode in temp file | <20 lines, deleted after |

### 4.2 Size Limits for Experiments

**SMALL (Orchestrator CAN do):**
- < 20 lines of throwaway code
- < 5 minutes execution time
- Single file in /tmp or scripts_dev/
- No production impact
- Verification purpose only

**LARGE (Orchestrator MUST delegate):**
- > 20 lines of code
- > 5 minutes execution time
- Multiple files or modules
- Any code that will be committed
- Test suites or benchmarks
- Infrastructure setup

### 4.3 Experiment Workflow

```
1. Identify what needs verification (API? syntax? config?)
2. If SMALL: Write temp script, run, verify, DELETE
3. If LARGE: Document findings, delegate to worker agent
4. NEVER commit experiment code to project repo
```

### 4.4 Example Experiments

**Example - Verifying Docker Image Availability:**

```bash
# ALLOWED: Quick verification (orchestrator)
docker pull --quiet electronuserland/builder:wine 2>&1 | head -1

# FORBIDDEN: Full setup (delegate instead)
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d  # -> Delegate to worker
```

**Example - Testing API Endpoint:**

```bash
# ALLOWED: Single verification request (orchestrator)
curl -s "https://api.github.com/users/octocat" | jq '.login'

# FORBIDDEN: Building API client (delegate instead)
# Writing a Python script to interact with API -> Delegate to worker
```

---

## 5. Self-Check Before ANY Action

### 5.1 The Self-Check Procedure

Before taking ANY action, the orchestrator MUST ask:

```
SELF-CHECK:
1. Is this action RESEARCH (reading, searching, exploring)? -> PROCEED
2. Is this action DOCUMENTATION (writing .md files, plans)? -> PROCEED
3. Is this action DELEGATION (sending instructions to agents)? -> PROCEED
4. Is this action SMALL EXPERIMENT (<20 lines, <5 min, verification only)? -> PROCEED
5. Is this action LARGE EXPERIMENT or IMPLEMENTATION? -> STOP -> DELEGATE
```

### 5.2 What to Do When Self-Check Fails

If the answer to #5 is YES:
1. STOP immediately
2. Create delegation instructions instead
3. Send via AI Maestro to appropriate agent
4. Monitor for completion

---

## 6. Exception: Emergency Research Commands

### 6.1 Allowed Research Commands

```bash
# ALLOWED: Research commands
git status
git log --oneline -10
gh issue list
gh pr list
docker ps  # check what's running (not create new)
```

### 6.2 Forbidden Implementation Commands

```bash
# FORBIDDEN: Implementation commands
npm run build
cargo build
docker-compose up
git commit
git push
```

---

## 7. Practical Examples

### 7.1 WRONG Approach (Orchestrator Does Implementation)

```
User: Set up Docker containers for cross-platform testing
Orchestrator:
  - Creates docker-compose.yml
  - Writes test scripts
  - Runs docker-compose up
  -> RULE 15 VIOLATION
```

### 7.2 CORRECT Approach (Orchestrator Researches and Delegates)

```
User: Set up Docker containers for cross-platform testing
Orchestrator:
  1. Research: Check existing docker configs, CI workflows
  2. Research: Find docker images needed (electronuserland/builder, etc.)
  3. Plan: Create detailed task spec with all requirements
  4. Delegate: Send task to helper-agent-generic via AI Maestro
  5. Monitor: Wait for PR, review results
  -> RULE 15 COMPLIANT
```

---

## Enforcement Mechanism

Every orchestrator session MUST:
1. Read this rule at session start
2. Apply the self-check before each action
3. Log any role boundary violations
4. Report violations in session summary
