## 4.1 What is Integration Verification

Integration verification tests how multiple components work together. It is different from unit testing (which tests one component in isolation) and different from E2E testing (which tests the entire user workflow).

Integration verification tests:
- Two or more components working together
- Data flowing between components
- Component dependencies
- Component interfaces
- Error handling between components

**Example:** If you have a "User Service" component and a "Database" component, integration verification tests that the User Service can correctly save and retrieve users from the Database.

## 4.2 Why Integration Verification Matters

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Finds bugs unit tests miss | Inter-component issues |
| Tests component contracts | How components promise to communicate |
| Verifies data formats | Between components |
| Tests error propagation | Across component boundaries |
| Catches version mismatches | Library/API updates |
| Provides confidence | Before E2E testing |

## 4.3 Integration Verification Steps

### 4.3.1 Step 1: Identify Components to Test

Choose two or more components that work together.

### 4.3.2 Step 2: Prepare Test Environment

Set up all components in a test environment:
- Start services
- Initialize databases
- Create necessary files
- Set up network connections

### 4.3.3 Step 3: Define Integration Points

Identify exactly how components communicate:
- Function calls (what parameters, what return values)
- API calls (what requests, what responses)
- Database operations (what data written, what data read)
- File operations (what files written, what files read)

### 4.3.4 Step 4: Execute Component Interactions

Call one component and verify it correctly uses the other component.

### 4.3.5 Step 5: Verify Results

Check that:
- Component A called Component B correctly
- Component B processed the request correctly
- Component B returned the correct result to Component A
- Any side effects (database changes, files created) are correct

### 4.3.6 Step 6: Clean Up

Reset all components to a clean state.

## 4.4 Integration Verification Examples

### 4.4.1 API and Database Integration

```python
import sqlite3
import requests
import json

# Step 1: Identify components
# Component A: REST API
# Component B: SQLite Database

# Step 2: Prepare test environment
# Start API server (assumed running on localhost:5000)
# Create test database
test_db = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
cursor = test_db.cursor()
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT)''')
test_db.commit()

# Step 3: Define integration points
# API endpoint: POST /users
# Request format: {"name": "string", "email": "string"}
# Response format: {"id": 123, "name": "string", "email": "string"}
# Database: Insert row into users table

# Step 4: Execute component interactions
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/users', json={
    'name': 'Alice',
    'email': 'alice@example.com'
})

# Step 5: Verify results
assert response.status_code == 201, f"API returned {response.status_code}"
result = response.json()
assert result['name'] == 'Alice', "Name not stored correctly"
assert result['email'] == 'alice@example.com', "Email not stored correctly"

# Verify database state
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', (result['id'],))
db_record = cursor.fetchone()
assert db_record is not None, "Record not in database"
assert db_record[1] == 'Alice', "Database record incorrect"

# Step 6: Clean up
test_db.close()

print("Integration Test PASSED: API and Database work together correctly")
```

### 4.4.2 Microservices Communication

```python
import requests
import json

# Step 1: Identify components
# Service A: User Service (manages user data)
# Service B: Email Service (sends emails)

# Step 2: Prepare test environment
# Both services running in test environment
user_service_url = 'http://localhost:8001'
email_service_url = 'http://localhost:8002'

# Step 3: Define integration points
# User Service -> Email Service: When user registers, call Email Service to send welcome email
# Email Service: Accepts email_service_url/send request

# Step 4: Execute component interactions
# User Service calls Email Service
user_response = requests.post(f'{user_service_url}/users/register', json={
    'name': 'Bob',
    'email': 'bob@example.com'
})

# Check User Service response
assert user_response.status_code == 201, "User registration failed"

# Check if Email Service was called
# (This might involve checking a log, database, or making a request to Email Service)
email_logs = requests.get(f'{email_service_url}/logs')
email_logs_data = email_logs.json()

# Verify email was sent
email_sent = any(
    log['to'] == 'bob@example.com' and 'welcome' in log['subject'].lower()
    for log in email_logs_data
)
assert email_sent, "Welcome email was not sent"

# Step 5: Verify results
print("Integration Test PASSED: User Service and Email Service work together")

# Step 6: Clean up
# (Clean up test users, clear email logs, etc.)
```

## 4.5 When to Use Integration Verification

| Scenario | Why |
|----------|-----|
| After writing integration code | Verify components connect correctly |
| Before unit testing | Understand how components should work together |
| When changing component interfaces | Ensure compatibility |
| When updating third-party libraries | Verify no breaking changes |
| To troubleshoot component failures | Isolate integration issues |
