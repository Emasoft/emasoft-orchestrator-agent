## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operation ID | `op-send-pretask-interview` |
| Procedure | `proc-clarify-tasks` |
| Workflow Step | Step 14 |
| Trigger | Task assignment to implementer agent |
| Actor | Orchestrator (EOA) |
| Target | Implementer agent |

---

## Purpose

Send structured interview questions to an implementer agent BEFORE they begin work. This operation verifies the implementer understands the task, has required capabilities, and identifies potential blockers.

---

## Prerequisites

- Task assignment message already sent to implementer
- Implementer has acknowledged (ACK) the assignment
- AI Maestro API is accessible
- Issue number and requirements are known

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `implementer_agent_id` | Yes | Target agent session name |
| `issue_number` | Yes | GitHub issue number (e.g., `#42`) |
| `task_summary` | Yes | Brief description of the task |
| `acceptance_criteria` | Yes | List of requirements to implement |

---

## Steps

1. **Construct the interview message** with the five key questions:
   - Task summary in your own words
   - Acceptance criteria understanding
   - Concerns (requirements/design/capability/dependencies)
   - Implementation approach
   - Blockers

2. **Format the message** using the pre-task interview template

3. **Send the interview** using the `agent-messaging` skill:
   - **Recipient**: the implementer agent session name
   - **Subject**: "Pre-Task Interview: <issue_number>"
   - **Content**: the formatted interview questions
   - **Type**: `request`, **Priority**: `high`

   **Verify**: confirm message delivery.

4. **Log the interview request** in handoff document

5. **Wait for implementer response** before proceeding

## Message Template

```markdown
## Pre-Task Interview: <issue_number>

Before you begin implementation, please answer these questions:

1. **Task Summary**: Describe the task in your own words. What are you building?

2. **Acceptance Criteria**: List the specific acceptance criteria you will implement:
   - [ ] Criterion 1
   - [ ] Criterion 2
   - [ ] Criterion 3

3. **Concerns**: Do you have concerns about any of the following?
   - Requirements clarity
   - Design approach
   - Your capability/tools
   - Dependencies on other modules

4. **Implementation Approach**: Briefly describe how you plan to implement this.

5. **Blockers**: Are there any blockers preventing you from starting?

Reply with your answers. Do not begin implementation until you receive PROCEED.
