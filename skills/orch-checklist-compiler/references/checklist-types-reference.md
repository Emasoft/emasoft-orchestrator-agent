## 1. Module Completion Checklists

### 1.1 When to Use

Use module completion checklists when verifying that a module is complete and ready for integration into the larger system.

### 1.2 Standard Elements

| Element | Description | Verification Method |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Implementation status | All functions/classes implemented | Compare spec vs. implementation |
| Documentation completeness | Docstrings, comments, README | Docstring checker script |
| Test coverage requirements | Unit tests, integration tests | Coverage report |
| Error handling verification | Exceptions, edge cases | Code review + tests |
| Type annotations completeness | Python typing, TypeScript types | Type checker (mypy, tsc) |
| Dependencies documentation | requirements.txt, package.json | File existence check |
| Interface compliance | API contracts, type signatures | Contract tests |
| Performance baselines | Response times, memory usage | Benchmark tests |
| Security considerations | Input validation, sanitization | Security scan |
| Integration points verified | Imports, exports, APIs | Integration tests |

## 2. Quality Gate Checklists

### 2.1 When to Use

Use quality gate checklists when verifying that quality standards are met before progression to the next phase (e.g., before merging, before release).

### 2.2 Standard Elements

| Element | Description | Verification Method |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Code quality metrics | Complexity, maintainability | Static analysis tools |
| Test pass rates | 100% pass for critical paths | Test runner |
| Code coverage thresholds | Line coverage, branch coverage | Coverage report |
| Linting compliance | No errors, warnings within limits | Linter (ruff, eslint) |
| Type checking status | No type errors | Type checker |
| Documentation standards | All public APIs documented | Documentation checker |
| Security scans | No high/critical vulnerabilities | Security scanner |
| Performance benchmarks | Response times, memory usage | Benchmark suite |
| Dependency audit | No known vulnerabilities | Dependency checker |
| Build success | Clean builds, no warnings | Build system |

## 3. Review Checklists

### 3.1 When to Use

Use review checklists when conducting thorough reviews of code, documentation, and deliverables (e.g., PR reviews, documentation reviews).

### 3.2 Standard Elements

| Element | Description | Verification Method |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Code structure review | Organization, modularity, SoC | Manual review |
| Naming conventions | Consistent, descriptive, standard | Manual review + linter |
