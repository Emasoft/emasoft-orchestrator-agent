# Claude Code Action Integration

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Anthropic API key (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret)
- Repository write permissions configured
- Understanding of GitHub Actions workflow syntax

## Instructions

1. Choose the appropriate workflow template from `templates/workflows/` based on your use case (PR review, @claude mention, or issue triage)
2. Copy the selected YAML file to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory
3. Add the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret in your repository settings under Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
4. Configure repository permissions by enabling "Read and write permissions" and "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" in Settings > Actions > General
5. Customize the workflow file if needed (model selection, allowed tools, custom prompts)
6. Test the workflow on a draft PR or test issue to verify it triggers correctly
7. Monitor API usage and costs after deployment

## Trigger Conditions

- User asks to "set up automated code review"
- User wants "Claude to review PRs automatically"
- User asks about "GitHub Actions with Claude"
- User needs "@claude mention integration"
- User wants "automated issue triage"

---

## Overview

The `claude-code-action` is Anthropic's official GitHub Action for running Claude Code in CI/CD workflows. This skill provides ready-to-use workflow templates for common integration patterns.

## Available Templates

| Template | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **claude-pr-review.yml** | Automatic PR code review | `templates/workflows/` |
| **claude-mention.yml** | @claude mention responses | `templates/workflows/` |
| **claude-issue-triage.yml** | Automated issue triage | `templates/workflows/` |

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose a Template

Select the workflow template that matches your use case from `templates/workflows/`.

### Step 2: Copy to Repository

Copy the YAML file to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory:

```bash
# Example: Set up PR review
cp claude-pr-review.yml /path/to/repo/.github/workflows/
```

### Step 3: Configure Secrets

Add required secrets in your repository settings:

1. Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your Anthropic API key

### Step 4: Configure Permissions

1. Go to **Settings > Actions > General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

## Customization

### Changing the Model

Edit the `claude_args` section in any workflow:

```yaml
claude_args: |
  --model "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # or claude-opus-4-5-20251101
```

### Restricting Tools

Modify the `--allowedTools` argument to limit what Claude can do:

```yaml
--allowedTools "Read,Glob,Grep"  # Read-only, no bash
```

### Custom Prompts

Edit the `prompt` section to customize Claude's behavior for your project's specific needs.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic PR Review Setup

```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-review.yml
name: Claude PR Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          prompt: "Review this PR for code quality and potential bugs"
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Example 2: @claude Mention Handler

```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-mention.yml
name: Claude Mention

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  respond:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          prompt: "Respond to this comment helpfully"
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

## Error Handling

### Workflow Not Triggering

1. Check workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
2. Verify YAML syntax is valid
3. Ensure trigger conditions match your action

### Authentication Errors

1. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set
2. Check API key has not expired
3. Ensure key has required permissions

### Permission Denied Errors

1. Enable "Read and write permissions" in repository settings
2. Add required permissions block to workflow

### Timeout Issues

1. Increase `timeout-minutes` in workflow
2. Consider using a faster model for large repos
