## Assignment Labels (`assign:*`)

**Purpose:** Track which agent is assigned to work on an issue.

**CRITICAL:** In single-account mode, `assign:*` labels REPLACE GitHub assignees for agent tracking.

| Label | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `assign:<agent-session-name>` | Specific agent assigned | When EOA assigns task to agent |
| `assign:implementer-1` | First implementer agent | For code implementation tasks |
| `assign:implementer-2` | Second implementer agent | For parallel implementation |
| `assign:code-reviewer` | Code review agent | For PR review tasks |
| `assign:orchestrator` | Orchestrator handling | When EOA handles directly |
| `assign:human` | Human developer | When human intervention needed |
| `assign:remote` | Remote agent (any) | For remote execution tasks |
| `assign:local` | Local agent | For local execution tasks |

**Rules:**
- An issue should have AT MOST ONE `assign:*` label at a time
- When reassigning, REMOVE old `assign:*` label BEFORE adding new one
- Use `gh issue edit --remove-label "assign:old" --add-label "assign:new"`

**Assignment Authority:**

| Agent | Authority | When to Use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **EOA** | Primary | Normal task assignment during orchestration |
| **ECOS** | Override | Agent failure, termination, or replacement |
| **EIA** | Limited | Only for `assign:code-reviewer` on PRs |
| **EAMA** | Limited | Only for `assign:human` escalations |

**Conflict Resolution:**
1. If EOA and ECOS both try to assign, ECOS wins (lifecycle takes priority)
2. If assignment conflict detected, message the other agent before changing
3. Use AI Maestro to coordinate: `{"type": "request", "message": "Requesting assignment of #42 to implementer-2"}`

## Status Labels (`status:*`)

**Purpose:** Track the current workflow state of an issue.

| Label | Description | Who Sets It |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `status:needs-triage` | Needs review and prioritization | Created automatically or by user |
| `status:backlog` | Ready but not started | EOA after triage |
| `status:ready` | Ready to be worked on | EOA when assigning |
| `status:in-progress` | Currently being worked on | Assigned agent when starting |
| `status:blocked` | Cannot proceed | Agent when blocked |
| `status:needs-review` | PR ready for review | Agent after creating PR |
| `status:needs-info` | Waiting for more information | Anyone when info missing |
| `status:on-hold` | Intentionally paused | EOA or ECOS |
| `status:done` | Completed | EIA after verification |

**Rules:**
- An issue should have EXACTLY ONE `status:*` label
- Status transitions follow a defined workflow
- Always update status when issue state changes

**Status Workflow:**
```
needs-triage → backlog → ready → in-progress → needs-review → done
                                      ↓
                                   blocked → (resolved) → in-progress
                                      ↓
                                   on-hold → (resumed) → in-progress
```

## Priority Labels (`priority:*`)
