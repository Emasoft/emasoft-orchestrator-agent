## Preconditions

- Task is currently assigned to an agent
- Reassignment is necessary (agent unresponsive after full escalation, or agent at capacity)
- New agent has been selected

## When to Reassign

| Situation | Reassign? |

| `new_agent` | string | Yes | New agent name |
| `reason` | string | Yes | Reason for reassignment |
| `repo` | string | Yes | Repository in `owner/repo` format |

## Procedure

1. Confirm reassignment is necessary
2. Gather partial progress from original agent (check issue comments, PRs, branches)
3. Remove current `assign:*` label from the issue
4. Add `assign:<new-agent>` label to the issue
5. Send reassignment message to new agent with full context and partial progress
6. Notify original agent that task has been reassigned
7. Verify new agent sends ACK
8. Log reassignment in delegation log

## Commands

```bash
ISSUE=42
OLD_AGENT="implementer-1"
NEW_AGENT="implementer-2"
REASON="Original agent unresponsive after 3 reminders"

# Step 3: Remove old assignment
gh issue edit $ISSUE --remove-label "assign:$OLD_AGENT"

# Step 4: Add new assignment
gh issue edit $ISSUE --add-label "assign:$NEW_AGENT"

# Step 5: Message new agent
curl -X POST "$AIMAESTRO_API/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"to\": \"$NEW_AGENT\",
    \"subject\": \"Task Reassignment: Issue #$ISSUE\",
    \"priority\": \"high\",
    \"content\": {
      \"type\": \"reassignment\",
      \"message\": \"Task #$ISSUE has been reassigned to you from $OLD_AGENT. Reason: $REASON. Please review existing progress and continue.\",
      \"data\": {
        \"issue_number\": $ISSUE,
        \"previous_agent\": \"$OLD_AGENT\",
        \"partial_progress\": \"See issue comments for work completed so far\"
      }
    }
  }"

# Step 6: Notify old agent
curl -X POST "$AIMAESTRO_API/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"to\": \"$OLD_AGENT\",
    \"subject\": \"Task Reassigned: Issue #$ISSUE\",
    \"priority\": \"normal\",
    \"content\": {
      \"type\": \"notification\",
      \"message\": \"Task #$ISSUE has been reassigned to $NEW_AGENT. Reason: $REASON.\"
    }
  }"
```

## Partial Progress Gathering

Before reassigning, gather any partial progress:

1. **Issue comments** - Check for status updates
2. **Branches** - `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("issue-42"))'`
3. **Draft PRs** - `gh pr list --state all --search "head:issue-42"`
4. **Handoff docs** - Check `docs_dev/handoffs/`

Include all partial progress in the reassignment message.

## Output

```json
{
  "reassigned": true,
  "issue_number": 42,
  "from_agent": "implementer-1",
  "to_agent": "implementer-2",
  "reason": "Agent unresponsive after 3 reminders",
  "partial_progress_included": true
}
```
