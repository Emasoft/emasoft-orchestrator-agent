## 1. Proactive Monitoring Principles

### 1.1 Why Proactive Monitoring is Critical

The orchestrator MUST PROACTIVELY monitor implementer agents. Do not wait passively for updates - actively reach out to ensure progress and completion.

Passive monitoring leads to:
- Agents getting stuck without reporting
- Tasks incomplete without notification
- Problems discovered too late to fix
- Wasted orchestrator context waiting

### 1.2 The Five Proactive Principles

1. **PROACTIVELY poll** for agent status every 10-15 minutes during active work
2. **PROACTIVELY send** status request messages if no update received
3. **PROACTIVELY offer** solutions when agents report blockers
4. **PROACTIVELY remind** agents of pending tasks and priorities
5. **PROACTIVELY verify** that agents don't stop until ALL tasks are complete

## 2. PROACTIVE Status Request Protocol

### 2.1 When to Send Status Requests

Send a status request when an implementer has been silent for more than 15 minutes.

**Triggers for status request:**
- No message received in 15+ minutes
- Agent marked task as "in progress" but no update
- Expected deliverable time has passed
- Other dependent tasks are waiting

### 2.2 Status Request Message Template

Use this template when requesting status:

```
PROACTIVE STATUS REQUEST:

[AGENT_NAME], I'm checking on your progress:

Current task: [TASK_DESCRIPTION]
Expected deliverable: [DELIVERABLE]
Time since last update: [TIME]

Please respond with:
1. Current status (working/blocked/complete)
2. What you've accomplished so far
3. Any blockers or issues
4. Estimated time to completion

If you're blocked, I can help unblock you.
```

---

## 3. PROACTIVE Unblocking Protocol

### 3.1 When an Agent Reports a Blocker

When an agent reports being blocked, respond IMMEDIATELY with solutions. Do not wait for the agent to figure it out alone.

**Blocker categories and typical solutions:**

| Blocker Type | Immediate Action |
|--------------|------------------|
| Missing dependency | Provide install command |
| API not responding | Provide alternative endpoint or test command |
| Permission denied | Escalate to user for access |
| Unclear specification | Provide clarification immediately |
| Code conflict | Provide merge resolution guidance |

### 3.2 Unblocking Response Template

Use this template when responding to blockers:

```
PROACTIVE UNBLOCKING RESPONSE:

I see you're blocked on: [BLOCKER_DESCRIPTION]

Proposed solution:
[SOLUTION_1]
[SOLUTION_2]
[ALTERNATIVE_APPROACH]

Try the proposed solution. If it doesn't work, report back immediately and I'll provide additional guidance.

Do NOT wait passively - try the solution now and report results.
```

## 4. PROACTIVE Task Completion Enforcement

### 4.1 Before Allowing Agent to Stop

When an agent indicates they want to stop, BEFORE allowing it:

1. **PROACTIVELY verify** all assigned tasks are complete
2. **PROACTIVELY request** evidence of completion (test results, build logs)
3. **PROACTIVELY challenge** any incomplete work
4. **PROACTIVELY require** 4 verification loops before PR (see verification-loops.md)

### 4.2 Verification Requirements

An agent may only stop when:

| Condition | Evidence Required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Task complete | Test results passing |
| Code committed | Git log showing commit |
| PR ready | PR URL provided |
| Documentation updated | Diff showing changes |
| No outstanding issues | Issue tracker shows none |

If any condition is not met, send:

```
COMPLETION VERIFICATION FAILED:

You indicated completion, but I cannot verify:
- [MISSING_CONDITION_1]
- [MISSING_CONDITION_2]

Please provide evidence of completion or continue working until complete.
Do NOT stop until all conditions are verified.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding to Status Requests

If an agent does not respond after 2 status requests:
1. Wait 5 more minutes
2. Send a third request with URGENT prefix
3. If still no response, escalate to user
4. Consider agent may be stuck in blocking operation

### Agent Reports Same Blocker Repeatedly

If an agent reports the same blocker more than twice:
1. The provided solutions are not working
2. Escalate to user for alternative approaches
3. Consider reassigning task to different agent
4. Document the blocker for future reference

### Agent Claims Completion But Evidence Missing

If agent claims completion but cannot provide evidence:
1. Do NOT approve PR or task closure
2. Request specific evidence items
3. If evidence not provided after 2 requests, mark task as incomplete
4. Escalate to user for verification
