# Task Complexity Classifier

## Task Complexity Assessment

Understanding task complexity helps orchestrators make efficient delegation decisions. This classification system evaluates tasks based on scope, dependencies, and coordination requirements rather than time estimates.

## Use-Case Quick Reference

**When to use this guide:**
- When deciding if a task needs planning → [Classification Process](#classification-process)
- If task involves single language with standard libs → [Simple Task](#simple-task)
- When task requires external packages and architecture → [Medium Task](#medium-task)
- If task spans multiple languages or platforms → [Complex Task](#complex-task)
- When uncertain between complexity levels → [Practical Tips](#practical-tips) > When in Doubt
- If you're over-planning a simple task → [Anti-Patterns to Avoid](#anti-patterns-to-avoid) > Over-Planning Simple Tasks
- When task becomes simpler during planning → [Practical Tips](#practical-tips) > De-escalation Signals
- If you need examples to compare against → [Examples](#examples)

## Simple Task

**Estimated Effort**: Minimal

### Criteria

- **Single language**: Only one programming language or technology involved
- **Standard dependencies**: No external dependencies beyond standard libraries or well-established core packages
- **No multi-platform native code**: Runs on a single platform or uses platform-agnostic code
- **Clear, well-defined scope**: Requirements are explicit and unambiguous with no architectural decisions needed
- **Single focused session**: Can be completed in one uninterrupted work session without context switching
- **Minimal files**: Typically affects 1-3 files maximum
- **No integration points**: Does not require coordination with external services, APIs, or systems
- **Straightforward testing**: Tests are obvious and simple to write

### Action

**Skip formal planning** - Delegate directly to developer agent with clear instructions

### Example Pattern

```
Simple task detected:
→ Direct delegation to specialized agent
→ No planning overhead
→ Fast execution
```

---

## Medium Task

**Estimated Effort**: Moderate

### Criteria

- **Single language with library dependencies**: Requires external packages or frameworks beyond standard library
- **Basic architecture needed**: Some design decisions required but within established patterns
- **Tests required**: Needs comprehensive test coverage with multiple test cases
- **Multiple files but single module**: Affects several files but all within one cohesive module or component
- **Established patterns**: Can follow existing codebase conventions and structures
- **Some coordination**: May need to verify compatibility with other components
- **Documentation needed**: Requires updating or creating documentation

### Action

**Brief planning** - Quick architecture review, then single developer agent handles implementation

### Example Pattern

```
Medium task detected:
→ 5-minute planning phase (architecture sketch)
→ Delegate to single developer agent
→ Parallel testing agent for test writing
→ Brief review before completion
```

---

## Complex Task

**Estimated Effort**: Significant

### Criteria

- **Multiple languages or platforms**: Involves polyglot development (e.g., Python + JavaScript, native + web)
- **Multi-platform native code**: Requires platform-specific implementations (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- **External integrations**: Must coordinate with external services, APIs, databases, or third-party systems
- **Multiple developers/agents needed**: Work must be parallelized across multiple specialized agents
- **Architecture decisions required**: Fundamental design choices that affect system structure
- **Cross-module impact**: Changes ripple across multiple modules or services
- **Complex dependency management**: Intricate version compatibility or build system requirements
- **Substantial testing infrastructure**: Needs integration tests, end-to-end tests, or test environment setup

### Action

**Full planning process** - Comprehensive planning, team orchestration, phased execution, continuous integration

### Example Pattern

```
Complex task detected:
→ Planning phase: Architecture design, dependency analysis, task breakdown
→ Team formation: Assign specialized agents to parallel workstreams
→ Coordination: Regular checkpoints, integration verification
→ Testing: Multi-layer testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
→ Review: Comprehensive code review and validation
```

## Classification Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
Ask these questions:
1. How many languages/platforms are involved?
2. What dependencies are required?
3. How many files/modules will be affected?
4. Are there external integration points?
5. What architecture decisions are needed?

### Step 2: Count Complexity Signals
Count how many "complex" signals are present:
- Multiple languages: +1
- Multi-platform native: +1
- External integrations: +1
- Cross-module changes: +1
- Architecture decisions: +1
- 10+ files affected: +1

**Scoring**:
- 0-1 signals: Simple
- 2-3 signals: Medium
- 4+ signals: Complex

### Step 3: Apply Classification
Use the decision matrix and examples to validate your assessment.

### Step 4: Choose Action Pattern
- **Simple**: Direct delegation
- **Medium**: Brief planning + single agent
- **Complex**: Full planning + team orchestration

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Over-Planning Simple Tasks
**Don't**: Spend more time planning than executing
- Simple tasks don't need architecture diagrams
- Skip formal planning documentation
- Direct delegation is faster and efficient

### Under-Planning Complex Tasks
**Don't**: Dive into complex tasks without planning
- Complex tasks without plans lead to rework
- Missing integration points cause failures
- Lack of coordination wastes parallel effort

### Treating All Medium Tasks as Complex
**Don't**: Apply full planning to medium tasks
- Medium tasks benefit from brief planning, not full design docs
- Single developer can handle with light coordination
- Over-orchestration adds unnecessary overhead

---

## Practical Tips

### When in Doubt
If you're uncertain between two levels, consider:
- **Can one agent handle it?** → Probably not Complex
- **Are requirements crystal clear?** → Probably Simple
- **Do you need to coordinate multiple workstreams?** → Probably Complex

### Escalation Signals
Start with lower complexity assumption, escalate if you encounter:
- Unexpected integration requirements
- Cross-cutting concerns discovered mid-task
- Multiple blocking dependencies
- Architecture assumptions proven wrong

### De-escalation Signals
If a Complex task becomes simpler during planning:
- External integration already handled by library
- Multi-platform abstraction layer exists
- Fewer files affected than anticipated
→ Re-classify and adjust approach

---

## Summary

Task complexity classification enables efficient orchestration by matching planning effort to task requirements:

- **Simple tasks**: Minimal planning overhead, fast execution
- **Medium tasks**: Light planning, focused execution
- **Complex tasks**: Comprehensive planning, coordinated execution

The goal is not perfect classification, but **appropriate planning investment** for the task at hand.
