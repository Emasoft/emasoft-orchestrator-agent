# Developer Communication Skill

Teaches AI agents how to communicate effectively with human developers in code reviews, issues, technical discussions, and status updates.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Writing Pull Request review comments
- Responding to bug reports or feature requests
- Explaining technical decisions or architecture
- Resolving disagreements with other developers
- Providing progress or status updates
- Writing PR descriptions, commit messages, or release notes

## Key Principles

1. **Assume good intent** - Code that seems wrong may reflect hidden constraints
2. **Be specific** - Provide concrete examples, not vague feedback
3. **Separate blocking from non-blocking** - Mark required changes vs suggestions
4. **Acknowledge good work** - Recognition builds trust
5. **Provide context** - Explain *why*, not just *what*
