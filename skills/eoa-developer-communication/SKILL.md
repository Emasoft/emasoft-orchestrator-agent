# Developer Communication Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches effective communication with **human developers** - not AI agents. Human communication differs fundamentally from structured AI-to-AI message templates:

| Aspect | AI-to-AI Communication | Human Communication |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Format | Structured JSON/templates | Natural language |
| Tone | Neutral, task-focused | Warm, respectful, contextual |
| Context | Explicit, complete | Often implicit, requires inference |
| Feedback | Direct status codes | Nuanced, face-saving |
| Timing | Immediate processing | Async, variable attention |

**When to use this skill**: Any interaction where the recipient is a human developer - Pull Request comments, issue responses, technical explanations, status updates, or conflict resolution.

## Key Principles of Developer Communication

### 1. Assume Good Intent

Every developer you interact with is trying to do good work. Code that seems "wrong" may reflect constraints, legacy decisions, or knowledge you lack.

**Instead of**: "This approach is wrong"
**Use**: "I noticed this pattern - was there a specific reason for this approach? I was thinking X might work because..."

### 2. Be Specific, Not Vague

Vague feedback wastes time and creates frustration. Always provide concrete examples.

**Instead of**: "This code could be cleaner"
**Use**: "Consider extracting lines 45-52 into a `validateUserInput()` function - it would make the login flow easier to test"

### 3. Separate Blocking from Non-Blocking

Clearly distinguish required changes from suggestions. Use explicit markers.

**Blocking**: "This will cause a null pointer exception when `user` is undefined"
**Non-blocking**: "Nit: Consider using `const` here instead of `let`"

### 4. Acknowledge Good Work

Recognition builds trust and encourages best practices. Point out what's done well.

**Example**: "Nice job handling the edge case for empty arrays here - that would have been easy to miss"

### 5. Provide Context for Your Feedback

Explain *why* something matters, not just *what* to change.

**Instead of**: "Use dependency injection"
**Use**: "Using dependency injection here would let us mock the database in tests, reducing test runtime from 30s to 2s"

## Decision Tree: Choosing Communication Type

```
Is this about code you're reviewing?
├── YES → See pr-comment-writing.md
│   ├── Is it a blocking issue? → Request Changes
│   ├── Is it a suggestion? → Comment (non-blocking)
│   └── Is it praise? → Approve with comment
│
└── NO → Is this about an issue/ticket?
    ├── YES → See issue-communication.md
    │   ├── Bug report? → Acknowledge, reproduce, respond
    │   ├── Feature request? → Thank, set expectations
    │   └── Question? → Answer or redirect
    │
    └── NO → Is this explaining technical decisions?
        ├── YES → See technical-explanation.md
        │
        └── NO → Is this a conflict or disagreement?
            ├── YES → See conflict-resolution.md
            │
            └── NO → Is this a progress/status update?
                ├── YES → See status-updates.md
                │
                └── NO → See templates-for-humans.md for general formats
```

## Quick Reference: Communication Tone

| Situation | Wrong Tone | Right Tone |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Code issue | "This is wrong" | "This might cause X - what if we tried Y?" |
| Suggestion | "You should do X" | "One option would be X - thoughts?" |
| Bug found | "You broke the build" | "The build is failing - looks like it's related to X" |
| Disagreement | "That won't work" | "I have concerns about X because of Y - how about Z?" |
| Confusion | "This doesn't make sense" | "Help me understand the reasoning behind X?" |
| Urgency | "Fix this now" | "This is blocking deployment - can we prioritize?" |

## Checklist: Before Sending Any Communication

- [ ] Is the tone respectful and professional?
- [ ] Did I assume good intent?
- [ ] Is feedback specific with examples?
- [ ] Did I separate blocking from non-blocking?
- [ ] Did I explain *why*, not just *what*?
- [ ] Is there anything to acknowledge or praise?
- [ ] Would I feel good receiving this message?
