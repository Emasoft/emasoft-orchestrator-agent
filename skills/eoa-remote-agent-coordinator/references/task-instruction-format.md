# Task Instruction Format

## Contents

This document is the **index** for task instruction format documentation. Each section below links to detailed reference files.

### Quick Reference

- **[Overview](#overview)** - Critical principle: teach agents in every message
- **[Agent Response Templates](#agent-response-templates)** - Templates to link in task delegations
- **[Mandatory ACK Block](#mandatory-ack-block)** - Include this in EVERY task delegation

## Overview

This document provides the complete template for task instructions sent to remote developer agents. Following this format ensures tasks are executed EXACTLY as planned with NO deviations.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Remote agents DO NOT have access to the atlas-orchestrator skill. They do not know any protocols, formats, or expectations unless the orchestrator EXPLICITLY TEACHES them in each message. Every task delegation MUST include:
1. Complete instructions on HOW to respond
2. Template references the agent can download
3. Exact format for ACK, progress updates, and completion reports

---

## Agent Response Templates

Link these templates in EVERY task delegation so agents know exactly how to respond:

| Template | Path | When Agent Uses It |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| ACK Response | `templates/ack-response.md` | Immediately after receiving task |
| Progress Update | `templates/status-update.md` | At each checkpoint during work |
| Completion Report | `templates/completion-report.md` | When task is done or failed |
| Task Checklist | `templates/task-checklist.md` | Throughout task execution |
| GitHub Projects | `templates/github-projects-guide.md` | When updating issue status |

---

## Mandatory ACK Block

**EVERY task delegation MUST start with this block:**

```
================================================================================
ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

Before starting work, you MUST reply with an acknowledgment in this exact format:

[ACK] {task_id} - {status}
Understanding: {1-line summary of what you will do}

Status options:
- RECEIVED - Task received, will begin work immediately
- CLARIFICATION_NEEDED - Need more info (list your questions)
- REJECTED - Cannot accept task (explain why)
- QUEUED - Have prior tasks, will start after them

Example:
[ACK] GH-42-password-reset - RECEIVED
Understanding: Will implement password reset flow with email tokens

DO NOT begin work until you have sent this acknowledgment.
================================================================================
```
