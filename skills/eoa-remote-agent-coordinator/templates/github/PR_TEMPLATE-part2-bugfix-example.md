## Example: Platform Detection Bug Fix

```markdown
## Summary

Fixes platform detection bug where Docker containers running on macOS hosts were incorrectly identified as "macos" instead of "docker". The router now checks for the `ATLAS_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE` environment variable before detecting platform from host OS.

## Linked Issue

Closes #87

## Changes Made

### Core Changes
- Added `ATLAS_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE` environment variable support
- Updated platform detection to check override first
- Added validation for override values

### Files Modified
- `src/atlas/platform/detector.py` - Updated detection logic
- `src/atlas/config/environment.py` - Added override variable
- `tests/test_platform_detector.py` - Added override tests
- `docker/Dockerfile` - Set ATLAS_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE=docker
- `docs/platform-detection.md` - Updated documentation

## Toolchain Verification

**Platform Tested:** macos (Docker Desktop 4.26.1)
**Toolchain Template:** [templates/toolchains/macos-docker-debug.md](../toolchains/macos-docker-debug.md)

### Environment Used
```yaml
platform: macos
python_version: "3.12.1"
system_dependencies:
  - docker-desktop: 4.26.1
```

## Deployment Notes

Update Docker startup scripts to set `ATLAS_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE=docker`.

### Deployment Checklist
- [x] N/A - Database migrations
- [x] Configuration changes documented
- [x] Environment variables updated (new ATLAS_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE)
- [x] Backwards compatibility maintained
- [x] N/A - Rollback plan (env var simply ignored if removed)

## Screenshots/Recordings

N/A

## Additional Context

The bug was caused by platform detection running inside Docker containers and detecting the host OS instead of recognizing it's running in a container. This is fixed by explicitly setting the platform via environment variable in the Dockerfile.

## For Reviewers

### Focus Areas
Please pay special attention to:
1. Validation logic for override values
2. Backwards compatibility with existing platform detection
3. Docker container startup script changes

### Testing Instructions
To test this PR locally:

```bash
# 1. Checkout PR
gh pr checkout 87

# 2. Setup environment
source templates/toolchains/macos-docker-debug.md

# 3. Run tests
uv run pytest tests/test_platform_detector.py -v

# 4. Test in Docker
docker build -t atlas-test .
docker run atlas-test python -c "from atlas.platform import get_platform; print(get_platform())"
# Should print: docker
```

### Questions for Reviewers
- Should we also support ATLAS_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE in the config file, or only as env var?
```

1. **Root cause identified** - Clear explanation of why the bug occurred
2. **Backwards compatible** - Existing behavior preserved when env var not set
3. **Edge cases tested** - Invalid override values explicitly tested
4. **Deployment notes** - Clear instructions for updating Docker scripts
