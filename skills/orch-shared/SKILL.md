# Shared References

This skill provides shared reference documents that are used across multiple Atlas Orchestrator skills.

## Reference Documents

### Handoff Protocols ([references/handoff-protocols.md](references/handoff-protocols.md))

Standard protocols for handing off work between agents:

- When you need to transfer context between agents → Handoff Format
- If you need to document session state → Session State Schema
- When coordinating multi-agent workflows → Coordination Patterns
