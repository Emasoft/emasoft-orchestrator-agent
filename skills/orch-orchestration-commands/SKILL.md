# Orchestration Commands Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches how to use the orchestration phase commands in the ATLAS Tool-Chain. These commands manage the execution loop that coordinates remote agents to implement approved plans.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Start an orchestration phase to implement an approved plan
- Monitor the status of modules, agents, and assignments
- Check the orchestrator loop state and pending tasks
- Control or cancel the orchestrator loop
- Understand how the stop hook prevents premature exit

## Prerequisites

Before using orchestration commands, ensure:
1. Plan Phase is complete (via `/approve-plan`)
2. The state file `.claude/orchestrator-exec-phase.local.md` exists
3. You understand the Two-Phase Mode workflow (Plan Phase then Orchestration Phase)

---

## Command Summary

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/start-orchestration` | Activate orchestration phase | After plan approval, to begin implementation |
| `/orchestration-status` | View module/agent progress | To monitor implementation progress |
| `/orchestrator-status` | Check loop state and tasks | To see pending tasks across all sources |
| `/orchestrator-loop` | Start continuous task loop | To activate task-driven development loop |
| `/cancel-orchestrator` | Cancel active loop | To manually stop the orchestrator loop |

---

## Quick Reference: Starting Orchestration

**If you need to start the orchestration phase after plan approval:**

1. Run `/start-orchestration` (optionally with `--project-id` for GitHub sync)
2. Register agents with `/register-agent`
3. Assign modules with `/assign-module`
4. Monitor with `/orchestration-status` every 10-15 minutes

See [references/start-orchestration-procedure.md](references/start-orchestration-procedure.md):
- 1.1 When to start orchestration phase
- 1.2 Prerequisites verification checklist
- 1.3 Command syntax and options
- 1.4 Post-start agent registration workflow
- 1.5 GitHub Project integration setup

---

## Quick Reference: Monitoring Status

**If you need to check implementation progress:**

Use `/orchestration-status` to see:
- Module completion percentages
- Registered agents and their assignments
- Instruction verification status
- Progress polling history

See [references/status-monitoring.md](references/status-monitoring.md):
- 2.1 Understanding the orchestration status output
- 2.2 Reading module status indicators
- 2.3 Interpreting agent registry information
- 2.4 Tracking active assignments and polling
- 2.5 Using verbose mode for detailed diagnostics

---

## Quick Reference: Orchestrator Loop Control

**If you need to start or manage the orchestrator loop:**

The orchestrator loop monitors multiple task sources and prevents exit until ALL are complete:
- Claude Tasks via TaskList API
- GitHub Projects open items
- Task file markdown checklists
- Claude TODO list (session)

See [references/orchestration-loop-mechanics.md](references/orchestration-loop-mechanics.md):
- 3.1 What the orchestrator loop does
- 3.2 Task source monitoring and priority
- 3.3 Iteration counting and max iterations
- 3.4 Verification mode (4-loop quadruple-check)
- 3.5 Completion signals (ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE)
- 3.6 Stop hook behavior and blocking logic

---

## Quick Reference: Cancellation

**If you need to cancel the orchestrator loop:**

Use `/cancel-orchestrator` to:
1. Check if a loop is active
2. Read current iteration from state file
3. Remove the state file to stop the loop

See [references/cancellation-cleanup.md](references/cancellation-cleanup.md):
- 4.1 When to cancel vs let loop complete naturally
- 4.2 Cancellation procedure step-by-step
- 4.3 Cleanup of state files and locks
- 4.4 Recovery after unexpected termination

---

## State File Reference

**If you need to understand or debug state files:**

The orchestrator uses markdown files with YAML frontmatter to track state:
- `.claude/orchestrator-loop.local.md` - Loop state
- `.claude/orchestrator-exec-phase.local.md` - Execution phase state

See [references/state-file-format.md](references/state-file-format.md):
- 5.1 Loop state file format and fields
- 5.2 Execution phase state file format
- 5.3 Frontmatter field definitions
- 5.4 How to manually edit state files
- 5.5 State file corruption recovery

---

## Troubleshooting

**If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior:**

See [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md):
- 6.1 Loop won't start - common causes
- 6.2 Stop hook not firing - debugging steps
- 6.3 Tasks showing as pending incorrectly
- 6.4 Lock file issues and stale locks
- 6.5 Concurrent execution conflicts
- 6.6 Verification mode stuck
- 6.7 Helper script failures

## Python Scripts Reference

The following scripts implement the orchestration commands. Located in the plugin's `scripts/` directory:

| Script | Purpose | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `atlas_start_orchestration.py` | Activates orchestration phase | `/start-orchestration` |
| `atlas_orchestration_status.py` | Displays phase status | `/orchestration-status` |
| `atlas_check_orchestrator_status.py` | Shows loop state | `/orchestrator-status` |
| `atlas_setup_orchestrator_loop.py` | Creates loop state file | `/orchestrator-loop` |
| `atlas_orchestrator_stop_check.py` | Stop hook enforcement | Hook event |

## Command Details

### /start-orchestration

**Purpose**: Enter Orchestration Phase to coordinate remote agents implementing the approved plan.

**Syntax**:
```bash
/start-orchestration [--project-id PVT_kwDOBxxxxxx]
```

**Options**:
- `--project-id`: GitHub Project ID for Kanban synchronization

**What it does**:
1. Verifies Plan Phase is complete
2. Sets orchestration status to "executing"
3. Loads module list from approved plan
4. Enables stop hook enforcement
5. Prepares agent tracking structures

**Example**:
```
/start-orchestration --project-id PVT_kwDOB1234567
```

---

### /orchestration-status

**Purpose**: View current Orchestration Phase progress including modules, agents, and verification status.

**Syntax**:
```bash
/orchestration-status [--verbose] [--agents-only] [--modules-only]
```

**Options**:
- `--verbose`: Show detailed polling history and acceptance criteria
- `--agents-only`: Show only agent information
- `--modules-only`: Show only module status

**Output sections**:
- Phase status header (plan ID, status, progress percentage)
- Module status table with completion indicators
- Registered agents list (AI and human)
- Active assignments with verification and polling info

---

### /orchestrator-status

**Purpose**: Check orchestrator loop status and pending tasks across all sources.

**Syntax**:
```bash
/orchestrator-status [--verbose]
```

**Options**:
- `--verbose`: Show detailed debug information and recent log entries

**Output sections**:
- Loop active/inactive status
- Iteration count and limits
- Task sources with pending counts (Claude Tasks, GitHub, Task file, TODO)
- Current task preview
- Debug info (log file, lock file status)

---

### /orchestrator-loop

**Purpose**: Start orchestrator loop for continuous task-driven development.

**Syntax**:
```bash
/orchestrator-loop [PROMPT] [options]
```

**Options**:
- `--max-iterations N`: Maximum iterations before escalation (default: 100)
- `--completion-promise TEXT`: Promise phrase to trigger completion
- `--task-file PATH`: Markdown task file to monitor
- `--check-tasks BOOL`: Check Claude Tasks (default: true)
- `--check-github BOOL`: Check GitHub Projects (default: true)
- `--github-project ID`: Specific GitHub Project ID

**Example**:
```
/orchestrator-loop "Complete all pending authentication tasks" --max-iterations 50
```

---

### /cancel-orchestrator

**Purpose**: Cancel active orchestrator loop.

**What it does**:
1. Checks if loop state file exists
2. Reads current iteration number
3. Removes state file to stop loop
4. Reports cancellation with iteration count

**Note**: This command is hidden from slash command suggestions but remains functional.

---

## Stop Hook Behavior

The orchestrator stop hook (`atlas_orchestrator_stop_check.py`) enforces completion requirements:

**Blocking conditions**:
- Plan Phase incomplete (requirements not documented, plan not approved)
- Orchestration Phase incomplete (modules not implemented)
- Pending tasks in any monitored source
- Instruction verification incomplete
- Config feedback requests unresolved
- Verification loops remaining (4 required after all tasks complete)

**Completion signals**:
- Output `ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE` when all tasks genuinely done
- Output `<promise>YOUR_PHRASE</promise>` matching configured promise

**Recovery behavior**:
- Fail-safe exit on unrecoverable errors (prevents user trap)
- Conservative blocking when task status cannot be determined
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Lock file cleanup for stale processes
