# Operation: Compile Task Assignment Checklist

## When to Use

Use this operation when creating a checklist to verify a task is properly defined before assignment to an agent.

## Prerequisites

- Task has been identified (from issue, plan, or user request)
- Task scope is understood
- Target agent or agent type identified

## Procedure

### Step 1: Create Objective Section

```markdown
## Task Objective
- [ ] Goal is clearly stated
- [ ] Scope is well-defined
- [ ] Expected outcome documented
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Task is atomic (single deliverable)
```

### Step 2: Create Acceptance Criteria Section

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Functional requirements listed
- [ ] Non-functional requirements listed
- [ ] Testable criteria defined
- [ ] Edge cases identified
- [ ] Performance targets specified (if relevant)
```

### Step 3: Create Context Section

```markdown
## Context Information
- [ ] Related issues/PRs linked
- [ ] Prior work referenced
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Blockers identified (if any)
- [ ] Architecture context provided
```

### Step 4: Create Constraints Section

```markdown
## Constraints
- [ ] Technology constraints documented
- [ ] Time constraints stated
- [ ] Resource constraints noted
- [ ] Compatibility requirements listed
- [ ] Style/convention requirements noted
```

### Step 5: Create Resources Section

```markdown
## Resources
- [ ] Required documentation linked
- [ ] API specifications available
- [ ] Design documents available
- [ ] Test data/fixtures available
- [ ] Access credentials provided (if needed)
```

### Step 6: Create Handoff Section

```markdown
## Assignment Handoff
- [ ] Agent selected and available
- [ ] Agent has required skills
- [ ] Agent has required access
- [ ] Communication channel established
- [ ] Deadline communicated
```

### Step 7: Add RULE 14 Compliance Section

```markdown
## Requirement Compliance (RULE 14)
- [ ] USER_REQUIREMENTS.md exists and is current
- [ ] All user requirements addressed
- [ ] No technology substitutions without approval
- [ ] No scope reductions without approval
```

### Step 8: Assemble Complete Checklist

```markdown
# Task Assignment Checklist: <task-name>

**Generated**: <timestamp>
**Task ID**: <issue-number or task-id>
**Assignee**: <agent-id>
**Priority**: <critical/high/normal/low>

## Task Objective
[items from Step 1]

## Acceptance Criteria
[items from Step 2]

## Context Information
[items from Step 3]

## Constraints
[items from Step 4]

## Resources
[items from Step 5]

## Assignment Handoff
[items from Step 6]

## Requirement Compliance (RULE 14)
[items from Step 7]

---
**Assignment Ready**: [ ] YES / [ ] NO (missing items)
**Missing Items**: <list if any>
```

## Output

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Checklist | Markdown | Complete task assignment checklist |
| Assignment Ready | Boolean | Whether task is ready to assign |
| Missing Items | Array | Items that need attention before assignment |

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Unclear objective | Task too vague | Request clarification from user |
| No acceptance criteria | Task not properly scoped | Define measurable criteria |
| Agent unavailable | Selected agent busy | Select alternative or queue task |
| Missing dependencies | Blocked by other work | Wait or reassign blocking work |

## Example

```markdown
# Task Assignment Checklist: Implement JWT Token Validation

**Generated**: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z
