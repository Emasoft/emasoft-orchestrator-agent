## Overview

This document provides the complete template for task instructions sent to remote developer agents. Following this format ensures tasks are executed EXACTLY as planned with NO deviations.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Remote agents DO NOT have access to the atlas-orchestrator skill. They do not know any protocols, formats, or expectations unless the orchestrator EXPLICITLY TEACHES them in each message. Every task delegation MUST include:
1. Complete instructions on HOW to respond
2. Template references the agent can download
3. Exact format for ACK, progress updates, and completion reports

---

## Agent Response Templates

Link these templates in EVERY task delegation so agents know exactly how to respond:

| Template | Path | When Agent Uses It |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| ACK Response | `templates/ack-response.md` | Immediately after receiving task |
| Progress Update | `templates/status-update.md` | At each checkpoint during work |
| Completion Report | `templates/completion-report.md` | When task is done or failed |
| Task Checklist | `templates/task-checklist.md` | Throughout task execution |
| GitHub Projects | `templates/github-projects-guide.md` | When updating issue status |

---

## Mandatory ACK Block

**EVERY task delegation MUST start with this block:**

```
================================================================================
ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

Before starting work, you MUST reply with an acknowledgment in this exact format:

[ACK] {task_id} - {status}
Understanding: {1-line summary of what you will do}

Status options:
- RECEIVED - Task received, will begin work immediately
- CLARIFICATION_NEEDED - Need more info (list your questions)
- REJECTED - Cannot accept task (explain why)
- QUEUED - Have prior tasks, will start after them

Example:
[ACK] GH-42-password-reset - RECEIVED
Understanding: Will implement password reset flow with email tokens

DO NOT begin work until you have sent this acknowledgment.
================================================================================
```

## When Creating a New Task Instruction

```markdown
================================================================================
ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

Before starting work, you MUST reply with an acknowledgment in this exact format:

[ACK] [TASK_ID] - {status}
Understanding: {1-line summary of what you will do}

Status options:
- RECEIVED - Task received, will begin work immediately
- CLARIFICATION_NEEDED - Need more info (list your questions)
- REJECTED - Cannot accept task (explain why)
- QUEUED - Have prior tasks, will start after them

Example:
[ACK] GH-42-feature - RECEIVED
Understanding: Will implement the feature as specified

DO NOT begin work until you have sent this acknowledgment.
================================================================================

## Files to Modify

| File | Action | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/path/file1.py` | MODIFY | Add function X, update function Y |
| `src/path/file2.py` | MODIFY | Import X, call X from existing function |
| `tests/test_file1.py` | CREATE | Unit tests for function X |
| `docs/api.md` | MODIFY | Document new endpoint |

### File-Specific Instructions

#### src/path/file1.py
- Add `function_x()` after line 42
- Update `existing_function()` to call `function_x()`
- Do NOT modify `other_function()` - out of scope

#### src/path/file2.py
- Import `function_x` from file1
- Call `function_x()` in the handler

---

## Test Requirements

### TDD Sequence
1. **FIRST**: Write failing tests
2. **SECOND**: Implement to pass tests
3. **THIRD**: Refactor with tests green

### Required Tests

#### Unit Tests
- [ ] `test_function_x_valid_input` - Happy path
- [ ] `test_function_x_invalid_input` - Error handling
- [ ] `test_function_x_edge_case_empty` - Empty input
- [ ] `test_function_x_edge_case_large` - Large input

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] `test_endpoint_creates_resource` - Full flow
- [ ] `test_endpoint_returns_error_on_invalid` - Error flow

### Coverage Requirement
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- All branches must be tested

---

## Completion Criteria

### Code Quality
- [ ] All new functions have docstrings
- [ ] Type hints on all function signatures
- [ ] No linting errors (run: `ruff check`)
- [ ] Formatted (run: `ruff format`)

### Testing
- [ ] All new tests pass locally
- [ ] All existing tests pass locally
- [ ] Coverage meets minimum threshold

### Git
- [ ] Changes committed to feature branch
- [ ] Branch pushed to origin
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format

### Pull Request
- [ ] PR created against main
- [ ] PR description follows template
- [ ] PR linked to GH-[NUMBER]

### Documentation
- [ ] Code comments explain "why" not "what"
- [ ] API docs updated if applicable
- [ ] README updated if applicable

---

## Constraints

### MUST Follow
- TDD - tests BEFORE code
- FAIL-FAST - no workarounds
- Conventional commits
- Project style guide

### MUST NOT Do
- Add dependencies without approval
- Modify files outside scope
- Create workarounds for blockers
- Skip tests "to save time"

---

## Escalation Rules

### Escalate Immediately If
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Architecture decision required
- Spec is ambiguous or contradictory
- Blocked for more than 2 hours

### How to Escalate
Send message to `orchestrator-master`:
```json
{
  "type": "escalation",
  "task_id": "GH-[NUMBER]",
  "escalation_type": "[type]",
  "description": "[details]"
}
```

## Agent Response Instructions

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY IN EVERY TASK DELEGATION**

### How to Respond at Each Stage

| Stage | Action Required | Template to Use |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Task Received | Send ACK within 5 minutes | `templates/ack-response.md` |
| Starting Work | Update issue to "In Progress" | `templates/github-projects-guide.md` |
| Checkpoint Reached | Send progress update | `templates/status-update.md` |
| Blocked | Send blocker report immediately | `templates/status-update.md` (BLOCKED section) |
| Task Complete | Send completion report | `templates/completion-report.md` |

### Response Format Quick Reference

**ACK (immediately after receiving task):**
```
[ACK] GH-42-feature - RECEIVED
Understanding: Will implement X with Y approach
```

**Progress Update (at each checkpoint):**
```
[PROGRESS] GH-42-feature - Checkpoint 2: Implementation

Status: ACTIVE
Progress: 60% complete
Current: Finished core logic
Next: Writing tests
```

**Completion Report (when done):**
```
[DONE] GH-42-feature - Feature implemented and tested

## Summary
- Implemented X
- Added Y tests
- Updated documentation

## Verification
cargo test -> 15 passed, 0 failed

## Artifacts
- PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/43
- Branch: feature/GH-42-feature
```

### GitHub Issue Updates

When updating GitHub issue status:

```bash
# Move to In Progress (after ACK)
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUM] --add-label "status:in-progress"
gh issue comment [ISSUE_NUM] --body "[ACK] Starting work."

# Add progress update
gh issue comment [ISSUE_NUM] --body "[PROGRESS] Checkpoint 2: 60% complete"

# Move to In Review (after PR created)
gh issue edit [ISSUE_NUM] --add-label "status:in-review"
```

### Reporting Guidelines

1. **Keep summaries brief**: 1-2 lines to orchestrator, full details in report files
2. **Write detailed reports to files**: `docs_dev/reports/{TASK_ID}_completion.md`
3. **Include paths in messages**: "Report: docs_dev/reports/GH-42_completion.md"
4. **No verbose output**: Orchestrator needs summaries, not full logs
