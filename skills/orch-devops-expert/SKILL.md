## Quick Reference

### GitHub Runners Matrix

| Platform | Runner | Architecture | Free Tier |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| macOS | `macos-14` | ARM64 (M1) | 2000 min/month |
| macOS | `macos-13` | x86_64 | 2000 min/month |
| Windows | `windows-latest` | x86_64 | 2000 min/month |
| Linux | `ubuntu-latest` | x86_64 | 2000 min/month |

### Workflow Templates

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `templates/ci-multi-platform.yml` | Multi-platform CI |
| `templates/release-github.yml` | GitHub Release |
| `templates/security-scan.yml` | Security scanning |
| `templates/docs-generate.yml` | Documentation |

### Required Secrets per Platform

| Platform | Secrets |
|----------|---------|
| Apple | `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_ID`, `NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD` |
| Windows | `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` |
| Android | `ANDROID_KEYSTORE`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` |
| npm | `NPM_TOKEN` |
| PyPI | `PYPI_API_TOKEN` |

## TDD Enforcement Rules

```yaml
# Every pipeline MUST:
1. Run tests before build
2. Fail if coverage < 80%
3. Block PR merge if tests fail
4. Run tests on all target platforms
5. No test skipping without documented reason
```

## Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lint-format:        # Stage 1: Quality checks
  type-check:         # Stage 2: Type safety
  test-matrix:        # Stage 3: Tests on all platforms
  build-matrix:       # Stage 4: Build artifacts
  release:            # Stage 5: Release (tags only)
```

## Debug Scripts

Every workflow should have a debug script:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/debug_workflow.py` | Simulate workflow locally |
| `scripts/validate_yaml.py` | Validate workflow syntax |
| `scripts/setup_secrets.py` | Configure GitHub secrets |

## Handoff Protocol

### From Modularizer Expert
Receive:
- Module list with platform targets
- Build system requirements
- Test matrix requirements

### Output
Provide:
- Complete `.github/workflows/` directory
- Secret management documentation
- Debug scripts for each workflow
- Release checklist

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/debug_workflow.py` | Debug workflow locally |
| `scripts/validate_yaml.py` | Validate YAML syntax |
| `scripts/setup_secrets.py` | Configure secrets via gh CLI |
| `scripts/list_runners.py` | List available runners |

## IRON RULE

This skill NEVER executes code. All outputs are:
- GitHub Actions workflow files (YAML)
- Configuration files
- Documentation (Markdown)
- Script templates (for manual execution)

Actual pipeline execution happens on GitHub Actions runners.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: CI pipeline fails but tests pass locally

**Cause**: Environment differences between local and CI.

**Solution**:
1. Check CI environment variables vs local
2. Verify dependency versions match (package-lock.json, pyproject.toml)
3. Check for filesystem path differences (case sensitivity)
4. Review CI logs for environment-specific errors

### Issue: Docker build fails in CI but works locally

**Cause**: Docker cache differences or missing dependencies.

**Solution**:
1. Add `--no-cache` to CI docker build to eliminate cache issues
2. Check base image availability in CI environment
3. Verify all required files are in Docker context (not gitignored)
4. Check CI runner has sufficient disk space

### Issue: Deployment script times out

**Cause**: Network issues or slow operations not properly configured.

**Solution**:
1. Increase timeout values in deployment configuration
2. Check network connectivity between CI and deployment target
3. Verify credentials/tokens haven't expired
4. Split large deployments into smaller steps

### Issue: GitHub Actions workflow not triggering

**Cause**: YAML syntax error or trigger condition not met.

**Solution**:
1. Validate YAML syntax with online validator
2. Check branch/path filters match actual changes
3. Verify workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
4. Check repository Actions settings are enabled

### Issue: Secrets not available in workflow

**Cause**: Secret scope incorrect or name mismatch.

**Solution**:
1. Verify secret name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Check secret is set at correct scope (repo/org/environment)
3. For forks, secrets are not available by default
4. Use `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax
