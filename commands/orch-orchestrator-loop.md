# Orchestrator Loop Command

Execute the setup script to initialize the orchestrator loop:

```!
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/atlas_setup_orchestrator_loop.py" $ARGUMENTS
```

The orchestrator loop monitors multiple task sources and prevents exit until ALL are complete:
- Claude Tasks (personal orchestrator tasks)
- GitHub Projects (team/project issues)
- Task file (markdown checklist if specified)
- Claude TODO list (current session)

Work on the highest-priority pending tasks. The loop will continue feeding you back to work until everything is done.

When all tasks are genuinely complete, output: ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE
