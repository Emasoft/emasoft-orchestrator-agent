main.py - Main entry point for Orchestrator Agent Stop Hook (Modular Version).

This is the refactored version of orch_orchestrator_stop_check.py, split into
focused modules for maintainability. The hook checks multiple task sources
before allowing the orchestrator to exit.

Usage:
    python -m orch_stop_check.main < hook_input.json

The hook reads JSON from stdin and outputs a decision to stdout.
